Write a function called "is_alphabetic" that will determine if the letters in a word are in alphabetical order,
returning true or false. Passing a parameter of "best" should evaluate to true, while "patrick" would be false. 
Remember that you can compare two individual characters, so "'a' < 'b'" would be true. 
Also remember that a function will stop as soon as you return a value, skipping any subsequent code.

function is_alphabetic(in_str)

  declare counter
  declare sortida = True
  
  for counter from 1 to in_str.length-1 loop
    if in_str.at(counter) > in_str.at(counter+1) then
      return sortida = False
    end-if  
   end loop

end function
