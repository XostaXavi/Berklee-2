Write a function that takes a number parameter and finds the value of that position in the Fibbonacci Sequence. 
In the Fibonacci Sequence, the next number is determined by adding the previous two numbers together. 
Positions one and two are both 1, to start the sequence. Position three is 1 (position one) + 1 (position two), so 2. 
Item four is 1 + 2, or 3. Then 5, 8, 13, 21, and so forth. "fib(2)" should return 1, and "fib(6)" should return 8.

function fib(in_num)
  declare counter
  declare fib_out = 1
  declare fib1 = 0
  declare fib2 = 1
  
  for counter from 1 to in_num loop
    fib_out = fib1 + fib2
    fib1 = fib2
    fib2 = fib_out
  end loop

  return fib_out
end function
